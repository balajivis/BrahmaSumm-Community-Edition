**BrahmaSumm** is an advanced document summarization and visualization tool designed to streamline document management, knowledge base creation, and chatbot enhancement. By leveraging cutting-edge chunking and clustering techniques, BrahmaSumm reduces token usage sent to Large Language Models (LLMs) by up to 99%, while maintaining the quality of content. The tool provides intuitive document processing, stunning visualizations, and efficient querying across multiple formats.

At a fraction cost of directly sending to LLM, we can do a deep analysis of themes and other parts of the document, besides an elaborate summary. Here is a visual view of the first debate between Harris and Trump.

## Use Cases
- **Document Management**: Organize and retrieve key information from large document sets across different formats.
- **Chatbots**: Enhance chatbot responses with intelligent document summarization and retrieval.
- **Knowledge Base Creation**: Build robust knowledge bases from diverse content, enabling easy access to summarized insights.

## How It Works
1. **Chunking**: Documents are split into manageable, semantically meaningful chunks using advanced methods that avoid arbitrary splits.
2. **Clustering**: These chunks are clustered based on similarity, reducing the number of tokens sent to LLMs while retaining the core information.
3. **Visualization**: Use UMAP to visualize the document clusters, making the structure of the document easy to understand.
4. **Summarization**: BrahmaSumm generates high-quality summaries of your documents, even across large datasets.
5. **Vectorization**: Each chunk is vectorized, enabling efficient querying and advanced document retrieval.

## Planned Enhancements
- **Enhanced query-based summarization**: Enable users to query specific sections or keywords for customized summaries.
- **Support for more formats**: Expand format support to include additional document types.
- **Integration with enterprise tools**: API integrations with popular enterprise tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and more.
